# Coordinate_matching
 
 
##Â Description

This code is created to facilitate matching different catalogs on coordinates. It is mostly a fancy wrapper around Astropy's `match_to_catalog_sky()` method. However, this code solves a few more problems and provides additional functionality to help the matching process.
In short: this codes helps to find the optimal threshold for matching catalogs and will remove matches that are separate more than this value.
It also has the option to remove duplicates from our matching process and the process is done iteratively, to make sure no matches are lost. 

An detailed example can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. It shows how to match MaNGA to Galaxy Zoo DECaLS, based on coordinates. 
I obtained the MaNGA coordinates from [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/dr17/manga/) drpall, DR17. 
The Galaxy Zoo DECaLS coordinates can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08414). Both were taken on 4 Oct 2022.

This code has been tested with python 3.7.9, astropy 4.2, pandas 1.2.0, numpy 1.19.2, matplotlib 3.3.2.
